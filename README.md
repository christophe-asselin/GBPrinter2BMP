# GBcamera-ImageSaver
GBcamera ImageSaver implemented in python and arduino

This is an update that fixes the COM port search in Windows. - Note that you must run as administrator.

This also makes it possible to print images of any length, not just squares from GB camera.

See ascii art of your image in the console as it is processed from the GB!

Also added the changes from yohanes which fixes the bmp header to be more compatible.
